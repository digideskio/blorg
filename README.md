Blorg
=====

A flexible Node.js static blog / website generation engine.

Documentation coming soon, in the meantime, check out my blog @ http://r.va.gg and the build source @ https://github.com/rvagg/rvagg.github.com/tree/build and the output @ https://github.com/rvagg/rvagg.github.com 

Note particularly the [config.json](https://github.com/rvagg/rvagg.github.com/blob/build/config.json) that puts it all together. A priority is to simplify configuration, but for now feel free to copy stuff wholesale.

See [Morkdown](https://github.com/rvagg/morkdown) if you want an awesome Markdown editor for your posts.
